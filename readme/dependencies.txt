1. First of all you need to go to https://developers.google.com/resources/api-libraries/download/youtube/v3/java

Unzip this file and then include the main directory and the libs folder as an decencies through your IDE.

I have used IntelliJ IDEA and this is the final dependency screen which you should see.

Steps for adding external jars in IntelliJ IDEA:
Project Structure ( CTRL + SHIFT + ALT + S on Windows/Linux, ? + ; on Mac OS X)
Select Modules at the left panel.
Dependencies tab.
Add... ? Project Library ? Attach Jar.
Add... ? Directory ? Attach Directory.


2. Now you need to get yourself one of these API Keys to use Google's services.

You need to go to Google's Developer Console
https://console.developers.google.com/

Sign up using your Google Profile

Create a Project

Under APIs & Auth on the left hand menu, go to APIs

Locate YouTube Data API

Enable it

Now click on Credentials under the same menu

This application just needs to search YouTube, so we don't need OAuth here.

Create a new Key under Public API access

Use a Server Application and allow all IPs. This shall do for us.

Take the API Key and use it in your application directory or for security you can out it under a file in your src.

The way I have done is I have a file called youtube.properties under src, which contains this.

youtube.apikey=YOUR_SIMPLE_API_KEY_HERE

The code is configured to setup your API Key from this location

This is how the External Libraries look for my Project: http://prntscr.com/7f83ns
