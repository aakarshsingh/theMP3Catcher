1. First of all you need to go to https://developers.google.com/resources/api-libraries/download/youtube/v3/java

Unzip this file and then include the main directory and the libs folder as dependencies through your IDE.

Steps for adding external jars in IntelliJ IDEA:
- Project Structure ( CTRL + SHIFT + ALT + S on Windows/Linux, ? + ; on Mac OS X)
- Select Modules at the left panel.
- Dependencies tab.
- Click on the '+' button on the right side -> JARs or directories -> selected the directory where above downloaded files are extracted.
- Click on the '+' button on the right side -> libraries -> Java -> libs 

This is the final dependency screen which you should see in IntelliJ IDEA.

2. Now you need to get yourself one of these API Keys to use Google's services.

- You need to go to Google's Developer Console: https://console.developers.google.com/

- Sign up using your Google Profile

- Create a Project

- Under APIs & Auth on the left hand menu, go to APIs

- Locate YouTube Data API

- Enable it

- Click on Credentials under the same menu

- This application just needs to search YouTube, so we don't need OAuth here. Hence, just create a new Key under Public API access

- Use a Server Application and allow all IPs.

- Take the API Key and use it in your application directory or for security you can out it under a file in your src.

- The code is configured to setup your API Key from a file called youtube.properties under src, which contains this: youtube.apikey=YOUR_SIMPLE_API_KEY_HERE

This is how the External Libraries look for my Project: http://prntscr.com/7f83ns
